# Provide Feedback on Email and Calendaring standards support for the next versions of Outlook and Exchange

<p>Microsoft recognizes that enabling interoperability between
products from different vendors is important, particularly with respect to
email and calendaring functionality, as it helps our customers stay connected
and organized across their favorite services and devices.</p>

<p>Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook support the
following core and most commonly adopted email and calendaring standards:</p>

<ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol - <span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501">RFC 3501</a></span>):
IMAP allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a
server. This protocol allows Exchange users to access their email across a
broad range of IMAP clients and enables Outlook users to access email on IMAP
servers.</p>

</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3 - <span><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt">RFC 1939</a></span>):
POP3 is a broadly adopted standard for webmail service providers. Outlook uses
the POP3 protocol to retrieve messages from the server. The POP3 service for
Microsoft Exchange Server is used by clients that implement the POP3 protocol
to store and retrieve messages on the server.</p>

</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>iCalendar (<span><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt">RFC 5545</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5546.txt">RFC 5546</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2447.txt">RFC 2447</a></span>):
This common format facilitates the open exchange of calendaring and scheduling
information across the Internet. iCalendar is supported by both Outlook and
Exchange and enables syncing and publishing of calendar items across supported
services and servers, regardless of platform.</p>

</li></ul><p>Extensive documentation of this support is publicly
available at no charge on <span><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc973105(EXCHG.80).aspx">learn.microsoft.com</a></span>. Microsoft
will continue to support these standards in the next versions of Microsoft
Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook.</p>

<p>To ensure that Microsoft continues to invest in the
standards that are most valued by our customers, your feedback is essential.
You can tell us what email and calendaring standards you’d like to see in the
next versions of Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook by sending
