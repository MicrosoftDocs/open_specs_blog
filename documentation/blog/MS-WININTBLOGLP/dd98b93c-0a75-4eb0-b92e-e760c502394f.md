<p><b>Microsoft Message Analyzer – Retirement Notice </b></p>

<p>Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) was retired and its
download packages removed from microsoft.com sites on <b>November 25 2019</b>. 
There is currently no Microsoft replacement for Microsoft Message Analyzer in
development at this time.  For similar functionality, please consider using a
3rd party network protocol analyzer tool such as Wireshark. </p>

<p>If you already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed,
you may continue to use it, along with the OPN parsers you have already
downloaded. </p>

<p><b>Versions Affected</b></p>

<p>Versions 1.4 and earlier.</p>

<p><b>Reason for Deprecation</b></p>

<p>Microsoft Message Analyzer was last released in October 2016
and has not been under active development since that date. There are no plans
for further public releases of Microsoft Message Analyzer. </p>

<p><b>Impact</b></p>

<p>If you already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed,
you may continue to use it, along with the OPN parsers you have already
downloaded. Parsing ETW traces will also continue to work as before. However,
after November 25 2019, no versions of Microsoft Message Analyzer will be made
available for public download on Microsoft.com sites and you will no longer be
able to download OPN parsers. After November 25 2019 when MMA is launched, it
will attempt to connect to the back-end Feed service to check News and Assets
updates and an error message will appear. To dismiss this error message, see <span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-analyzer/procedures-using-the-asset-management-features#BKMK_DismissError">Dismiss
Error Message</a></span> in the MMA Operations Guide.</p>

<p><b>Recommendations</b></p>

<p>If you want to restore OPN parsers in an MMA installation
done after November 25 2019, follow the steps in the Backup and Restore OPN
Packages topic here: <span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/blog/ms-winintbloglp/6344e692-0783-4f0a-bb97-5a07b9167286">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/blog/ms-winintbloglp/6344e692-0783-4f0a-bb97-5a07b9167286</a></span>.</p>

<p>If you used Microsoft Message Analyzer to convert ETL-format
packet capture files to PCAP format, you can get the same functionality from
the <span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng">open
source etl2pcapng tool</a></span>.</p>
